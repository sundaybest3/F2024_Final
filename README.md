| 1. NounSmart_spelling    | For students to practice spelling of nouns with plural forms other than '-s'. | Teachers may ask students to use this app for review during pre- or post- activities. | (https://nounsmartspelling-hel4hpntntlt56hgphdgw4.streamlit.app/) |
| 2. NounSmart_countability | For students to find out the countability of nouns based on the sentences from the textbook.   | Teachers may use this app in grammar lessons after reading the text. It will help students to find grammatical features--e.g. determiners, verb forms -- that determine the countability of the noun.| (https://nounsmartcountability-8zeyyjclx4pwyjpfdtmyhk.streamlit.app/)        |
|3. NounSmart_irregulars| For students to practice irregular plural nouns |Teachers may give the word list first and then open a quiz session during classes or give them homework to complete a level. Since the words are quite difficult in the higher level, it will be a challenge for even the advanced level students. | (https://nounsmartirregulars-5xvnwrz796lsebgkjmyotk.streamlit.app/)  |
