ðŸŒ² Applying NounSmart in Classes
| App Name | Purpose | How to Use | App link | 
|----------|----------|----------| ----------|
| 1. NounSmart: Spelling    | For students to practice spelling of nouns with plural forms other than '-s'. | Teachers may ask students to use this app for review during pre- or post- activities. Items included are from Unit 1 as well as Unit2, which means items from Unit3 may be included later on. | [NounSmart_Spelling](https://nounsmartspelling-hel4hpntntlt56hgphdgw4.streamlit.app/) |
| 2. NounSmart: Countability | For students to find out the countability of nouns based on the sentences from the textbook.   | Teachers may use this app in grammar lessons after reading the text. It will help students to find grammatical features--e.g. determiners, verb forms -- that determine the countability of the noun.| [NounSmart_Countability](https://nounsmartcountability-8zeyyjclx4pwyjpfdtmyhk.streamlit.app/)        |
|3. NounSmart: Irregulars| For students to practice irregular plural nouns |Teachers may give the word list first and then open a quiz session during classes or give them homework to complete a level. Since the words are quite difficult in the higher level, it will be a challenge for even the advanced level students. | [NounSmart_Irregulars](https://nounsmartirregulars-5xvnwrz796lsebgkjmyotk.streamlit.app/)  |
